# banknoteRecognitionPython
Turkish Lira banknote detection and recognition Python application,
using keras model, openCV and machine learning.

This project was made as a semister project for the Computer Vision course of Istanbul Technical University.

The project contains 2 kind of files(.py and .ipynb),
and it has 1 validation file for testing the program and making the confusion matrix.

I also added 3 different keras models to chose from;

- keras_model_old:
the first keras model I trained using a dataset that I took myself.

- keras_model_mid:
I trained this model using part of the dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/baltacifatih/turkish-lira-banknote-dataset

- keras_model_strong:
I trained this model using all the dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/baltacifatih/turkish-lira-banknote-dataset
